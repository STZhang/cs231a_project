Specification of the scene structs
===================================

Top level:
- object_classes
- scene_classes
- GTs


The indoor3d MATLAB framework uses a struct array to represent a 
collection of scenes.

Let Ks be the number of scene classes, and 
    Ko be the number of object classes

Each element of a the struct array is a struct with the following fields:

- scene_label:  the class label of the scene
- scene_pots:   the scene classification potentials (1-by-Ks)
- objects:      the struct array of objects

In particular, objects(i) is the i-th object in the scene, which itself
is a struct, with the following fields:

- label:            the class label of the object
- use:              whether to use this object in training/evaluation
- bndbox:           the 2D bound box
- cube:             the object cube struct

- seg_pots:         the object segmentation potentials (1-by-Ko)
