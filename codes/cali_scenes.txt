A calibrated scene is represented by a MATLAB struct, stored in 

    <data_dir>/cali_scenes/sc####.mat

Here, #### is the index of the scene. To get the idx-th calibrated scene,
one can use the following MATLAB statement:

    s = load(fullfile(datadir, 'cali_scenes', sprintf('sc%04d.mat, idx)));

To view this scene, write:

    p3d_cali_view(s);

Here, s is a MATLAB struct with the following fields:

    Let h and w be the height and width of the scene image. (In NYU v2, 
    h and w are always 480 and 640).

    s.scene_type:   The class name of the scene [string]

    s.name:         A unique name to identify the scene [string]

    s.accel:        camera information [1 x 4]

    s.depths:       The polished depth map (without holes) [h x w]

    s.image:        The image [h x w x 3]

    s.instance:     The four-category map [h x w]
                    (NYU's ECCV 2012 paper classify points into four categories)

    s.labels:       The label map [h x w]
                    (The label map using our 35-class)

    s.raw_depths:   The raw depth map [h x w]

    s.wcoords:      The calibrated world coordinates [Npix x 3]
                    (In this dataset Npix = 480 * 640 = 307200)

                    If you do a reshape, as:

                        W = reshape(s.wcoords, [h w 3]);

                    Then 
                    s.wcoords(i,j,1), s.wcoords(i,j,2), and s.wcoords(i,j,3)
                    are the x-, y-, z-coordinate (calibrated) corresponding
                    to the pixel at s.image(i, j).


    s.walls:        The x-z coordinates of wall-like planes
                    This is a cell array:
                    each cell is a vector in form of [x0 z0 x1 z1]
                    These coordinates are relative to the calibrated
                    coordinate framework.
