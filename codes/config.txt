The Indoor3D framework uses the following a struct with following fields
to capture the settings:

Fields to list classes:

- scene_classes:        A cell array of scene class names

One can get the number of classes by looking at the number of elements
in these arrays.

- use_scene_score:      Use scene classification scores
- use_detect_score:     Use object detection scores
- use_segment_score:    Use segmentation-based scores
- use_scene_object:     Use scene-object relations
- use_object_object:    Use object-object relations

Fields to provide common potentials

- scene_object_pots:    The scene-object potentials
- object_object_pots:   The object-object potentials
